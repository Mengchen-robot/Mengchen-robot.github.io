## About Me
I am a Master's student in Robotics Engineering at Southeast University, advised by [Professor Yahui Gan](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085826914). My research focuses on Embodied AI and Reinforcement Learning, with a particular interest in developing intelligent robotic systems that can learn and adapt in complex environments.

**Research Experience:**
- **Previous Research**: State Key Laboratory of Robotics and System, Harbin Institute of Technology, supervised by [Professor Liang Ding](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=N_jCW-UAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN)
- **Current Role**: Research Intern at Shanghai AI Lab, supervised by [Dr. Hanqing Wang](https://hanqingwangai.github.io/)

I am passionate about advancing the field of robotics through cutting-edge research in artificial intelligence and machine learning, with the goal of creating more capable and intelligent robotic systems for real-world applications.
